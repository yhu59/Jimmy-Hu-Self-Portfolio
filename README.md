  <p> I am Jimmy, a Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering student at Johns Hopkins intersted in immunoengineering and medicine. I am passionate about the connections between chemistry and biology, specifically in regards to the immune system and seeing those applications in real life through collaboration. I am currently looking for projects to work on as a part of a design team and am eager to translate what I have learned into real life products.</p>
